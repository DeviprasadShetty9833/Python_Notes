# Python Basics

⏺️ **Print a string using print()**
  
*Code* : 
```html 
print("Hello World!")
```
*Output* : `Hello World!`    
> - Here, print() is a function that displays the msg 'Hello World' on the console.

⏺️ **Comments**

*Code* : 
```html
# This is a single-line comment.

""" This is a multi-line comment. """

''' This is a multi-line comment. '''

```
*Output* : ` ` 
> - Python ignores comments when running the code, but they help people understand what the code is doing.

⏺️ **Indentation**
