# Python Basics

 ![Print()](https://img.shields.io/badge/_1._-Print%20a%20string%20using%20print()-34A853?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)   
  
*Code* : 
```html 
print("Hello World!")
```
*Output* : `Hello World!`    
> - Here, print() is a function that displays the msg 'Hello World' on the console.

 ![Comments](https://img.shields.io/badge/_2._-Comments-34A853?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)   

*Code* : 
```html
# This is a single-line comment.

""" This is a multi-line comment. """

''' This is a multi-line comment. '''

```
*Output* : ` ` 
> - Python ignores comments when running the code, but they help people understand what the code is doing.









![Indentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/_2._-Indentation-34A853?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)

▶️ Indentation is used to define blocks of code.
▶️ All statements with the same level of indentation are considered part of the same block.
▶️ Indentation is achieved using whitespace (spaces or tabs) at the beginning of each line.

*Code* : 
```html
if 10 > 5:
    print("I have indentation.")

print("I have no indentation.")
```
> - The 1st print statement is indented by 4 spaces, so they belong to the if block.
> - The 2nd print statement is not indented, so it is outside the if block.
